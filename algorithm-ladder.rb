# The Collatz Conjecture or 3x+1 problem can be summarized as follows:

# Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide n by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply n by 3 and add 1 to get 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture states that no matter which number you start with, you will always reach 1 eventually.

# Given a number n, return the number of steps required to reach 1.

# Examples
# Starting with n = 12, the steps would be as follows:

# 12
# 6
# 3
# 10
# 5
# 16
# 8
# 4
# 2
# 1

# Resulting in 9 steps. So for input n = 12, the return value would be 9.

def collatz_steps(n)

  # until n == 1
  #   if n % 2 == 0
  #     n /= 2
  #   else
  #     n = 3 * n + 1
  #   end
  #   count += 1
  # end
  # return count

  if n == 1
    return 0
  else
    n = n % 2 == 0 ? n / 2 : 3 * n + 1
    return collatz_steps(n) + 1
  end
